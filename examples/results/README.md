# Example of k-Graph on the UCR-Archive datasets

In each file, we show: 
1. The dataset (each class seperated). In blue is one example time series of the dataset (one per class).
2. The selected graph (with gamma graphoids with gamma equal to 0.6).
3. The consistency and the interpretability factor for each length.
4. The 4 most representative and exclusive nodes per cluster.

The ARI obtained is in the name of the file.

Please note that k-Graph is non-derterministic (the length are randomly chosen at each run). Therefore, two run of k-Graph can lead to differnt results. Moreover, the graph layout is also non-derterministic. As a consequence, the aspect of the graph might be different, not only because of different clustering results but also because of a different layout for the graph plot.
